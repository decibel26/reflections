1) Share code in repositories on github (includes several personal and open-source projects)
   Collaborate on code projects with other individuals.
   * Public  -- Anyone can see/clone the git repository. You as a "maintainer" can choose who can commit. Do code reviews. Test infrastructure?
   * Private -- Paid. You can choose who can see and commit to the git repository.

2) Add ssh-key

3) In order to push/pull to/from github, you need to:
   * FIRST create the repository on github --> use the + button on the webpage
   * THEN label it on your local machine

4) Now you can view your repository files and commits on github.
   You can add new files on github itself OR push from a different computer.

5) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?


git remote                              # view remote repositories
git remote add <remote_label> <url>     # create label "remote_label" (eg: origin) to existing "url" on github
git push <remote_label> master          # push changes from local to remote
git pull <remote_label> master          # pull remote repo (eg: origin) changes to local repo branch master
