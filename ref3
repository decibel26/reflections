1) Share code in repositories on github (includes several personal and open-source projects)
   Collaborate on code projects with other individuals.
   * Public  -- Anyone can see/clone the git repository. You as a "maintainer" can choose who can commit. Do code reviews. Test infrastructure?
   * Private -- Paid. You can choose who can see and commit to the git repository.

2) Add ssh-key
   https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/

3) In order to push/pull to/from github, you need to:
   * FIRST create the repository on github --> use the + button on the webpage
   * THEN label it on your local machine

4) Now you can view your repository files and commits on github.
   You can add new files on github itself OR push from a different computer.

5) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

6) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

7) Forking = cloning any repo on github itself (while keeping the link to the original repo, and assigning credit to original author(s))
   On github, you can now ADD collaborators to the fork.
   You can now git clone the forked repo on your local machine, make edits, without affecting the original repo BUT having the link on github


git remote                              # view remote repositories

git remote add <remote_label> <url>     # create label "remote_label" (eg: origin) to existing "url" on github
git remote -v                           # view verbose description of remote repo labels
git push <remote_label> master          # push changes from local (master) to remote (remote_label)
Make changes on github / another machine
git pull <remote_label> master          # pull remote repo (eg: origin) changes to local repo branch master

Fork repo on github
git clone <url>                         # clone forked repo on local
git remote -v                           # already setup push and pull to remote_label (eg: origin)
